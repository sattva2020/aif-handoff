# Architecture

## Overview

AIF Handoff is a Turborepo monorepo with six packages. The system automates task management: a React Kanban UI lets users create tasks, the API and agent operate through a centralized data layer backed by SQLite, and runtime execution goes through `@aif/runtime` so orchestration is provider-neutral.

## Packages

| Package            | Name           | Purpose                                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/shared`  | `@aif/shared`  | Types, schema, state machine, constants, env, logger          |
| `packages/runtime` | `@aif/runtime` | Runtime/provider contracts, registry, adapters, module loader |
| `packages/data`    | `@aif/data`    | Centralized DB access layer (all SQL/repository operations)   |
| `packages/api`     | `@aif/api`     | Hono REST + WebSocket server (port 3009)                      |
| `packages/web`     | `@aif/web`     | React Kanban UI (port 5180)                                   |
| `packages/agent`   | `@aif/agent`   | Coordinator + runtime-driven subagent orchestration           |

### Dependency Graph

```
shared ← data
shared ← runtime
runtime ← api
runtime ← agent
shared ← web (browser export only)
data   ← api
data   ← agent
```

No cross-dependencies between `api`, `web`, and `agent`. Runtime integration is:

- `web` ↔ `api` via HTTP/WebSocket
- `agent`/`api` → `@aif/runtime` for run/resume/session/model-discovery flows
- `api`/`agent` → SQLite via `@aif/data`
- `agent` → `api` via HTTP for best-effort broadcast notifications
- Lint guard enforces this boundary: `api` and `agent` cannot import DB helpers from `@aif/shared` or SQL builders directly.

## Runtime Registry and Profile Resolution

Runtime execution is centralized in `packages/runtime`:

- `registry.ts` registers built-in adapters and optional external modules (`AIF_RUNTIME_MODULES`).
- `workflowSpec.ts` defines runtime-independent execution intent (`planner`, `implementer`, `reviewer`, one-shot API flows).
- `resolution.ts` merges profile data + env secrets + model/runtime overrides with capability checks.

Effective task profile selection order is:

1. Task override (`tasks.runtime_profile_id`)
2. Project default (`projects.default_task_runtime_profile_id`)
3. System default (optional runtime bootstrap configuration)

The same pattern applies to chat mode using `default_chat_runtime_profile_id`.

## Agent Pipeline

The coordinator (`packages/agent/src/coordinator.ts`) uses a dual-trigger model: it polls via `node-cron` every 30 seconds as a fallback and also reacts to real-time events from the API WebSocket (task creation, moves, and explicit `agent:wake` signals). Duplicate wakes are debounced. If the WebSocket is unavailable, the coordinator falls back to polling-only mode.

The coordinator supports **parallel task execution** (experimental, per-project). When a project has "Parallel Execution" enabled in settings, up to `COORDINATOR_MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS` (default 3) tasks per stage run concurrently via `Promise.allSettled`. This value also serves as the global cap on total concurrent Claude processes across all stages and projects. Non-parallel projects always process 1 task at a time. Tasks are atomically claimed (`lockedBy`/`lockedUntil` columns) with lock duration tied to the stage timeout; heartbeats renew the lock periodically. Stale claims (expired TTL or dead heartbeat) are auto-released. On shutdown, active locks are released immediately.

It delegates workflow stages to `.claude/agents/` definitions, but actual execution transport/model/session behavior is adapter-owned through `@aif/runtime`:

| Review → Done / Review → request_changes → Implementing | `review-sidecar` + `security-sidecar` (+ auto review gate in coordinator) | Code review and security audit in parallel; in auto mode, review comments are analyzed and may trigger automatic rework |

### Reliability Guards

The pipeline includes two reliability layers for long-running autonomous execution:

- **Heartbeat liveness:** Task rows are updated with `lastHeartbeatAt` during agent activity and stage transitions.
- **Stale-stage watchdog:** On each poll cycle, tasks stuck in `planning` / `implementing` / `review` beyond timeout are auto-recovered to `blocked_external` with retry backoff.
- **Transition reset:** valid transitions clear watchdog state (`blocked*`, `retryAfter`, `retryCount`) and refresh heartbeat baseline.

For stale `implementing`, recovery resumes from `plan_ready` to force a clean implementation pass instead of continuing a potentially inconsistent in-flight run.

### Layer-Driven Implementation Dispatch

Before launching `implement-coordinator`, the implementer computes dependency layers from the active plan (`.ai-factory/PLAN.md` or `.ai-factory/FIX_PLAN.md`) and injects a precomputed execution summary into the prompt.

This makes parallelism explicit:

- layers with one ready task are sequential,
- layers with multiple ready tasks are parallel and must dispatch `implement-worker` subagents.

### Agent Definitions

All agents are defined as markdown files in `.claude/agents/*.md` and loaded by runtimes that support agent definitions (e.g. Claude adapter via `settingSources: ["project"]`). The `agent` package orchestrates _when_ to invoke them; the markdown files define _what_ they do. For runtimes without agent definition support, the prompt policy falls back to slash-command injection.

## Task State Machine

Defined in `packages/shared/src/stateMachine.ts`. Human actions available per status:

| Status             | Human Actions                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `backlog`          | `start_ai`                                               |
| `planning`         | _(none — agent working)_                                 |
| `plan_ready`       | `start_implementation`, `request_replanning`, `fast_fix` |
| `implementing`     | _(none — agent working)_                                 |
| `review`           | _(none — agent working)_                                 |
| `blocked_external` | `retry_from_blocked`                                     |
| `done`             | `approve_done`, `request_changes`                        |
| `verified`         | _(terminal state)_                                       |

Tasks have an `autoMode` flag. When `true`, the agent automatically transitions through all stages. This includes an automatic post-review gate: review comments are analyzed, and if fix items are detected the coordinator applies a `request_changes`-style transition (`done -> implementing`) with an agent comment containing required fixes. When `false`, the user must manually trigger `start_implementation` from `plan_ready`.

Tasks also have a `skipReview` flag (default `false`). When `true`, the coordinator bypasses the review stage entirely — after successful implementation the task moves directly to `done`, skipping the `review-sidecar` and `security-sidecar` runs. This is useful for small changes or tasks where code review is unnecessary.

### Pause / Resume

Tasks have a `paused` flag (default `false`). When `true`, the coordinator skips the task in all selection queries:

- `findCoordinatorTaskCandidate` — paused tasks are not picked up for any stage (planning, plan-checking, implementing, reviewing).
- `listDueBlockedExternalTasks` — paused blocked tasks are not auto-released when their retry window elapses.
- `listStaleInProgressTasks` — paused tasks are not treated as stale by the watchdog, so they won't be force-recovered to `blocked_external`.

**Important:** pausing a task does **not** abort an already running runtime session. If a query is in flight, it will finish. The pause takes effect on the **next** coordinator cycle — the task simply won't be picked up for the next stage transition.

The Pause/Resume button is shown in the TaskDetail Actions bar for active processing stages (`planning`, `plan_ready`, `implementing`, `review`, `blocked_external`). It is hidden for `backlog`, `done`, and `verified` where the agent pipeline is not running.

## Roadmap Import

The system supports bulk task creation from a project's `.ai-factory/ROADMAP.md` file via `POST /projects/:id/roadmap/import`.

**Flow:**

1. API reads `ROADMAP.md` from the project root
2. Agent SDK (haiku model) converts markdown milestones into structured JSON
3. Response is validated via zod schema
4. Tasks are created in batch with deduplication (by `projectId + normalizedTitle + roadmapAlias`)
5. Each task receives automatic tags: `roadmap`, `rm:<alias>`, `phase:<N>`, `phase:<name>`, `seq:<NN>`
6. WebSocket broadcasts `task:created` per task and `agent:wake` after batch

**Deduplication:** Re-running import with the same alias is safe — existing tasks with matching titles are skipped. This makes the endpoint idempotent for reruns.

**Tag taxonomy:** Tags enable UI filtering. The `roadmap` quick filter in the Board shows only roadmap-generated tasks. When the roadmap filter is active, a sub-filter row displays all available `roadmapAlias` values (e.g., `v1.0`, `v2.0`) as clickable chips, allowing users to narrow results to a specific roadmap. Selecting no alias shows all roadmap tasks; selecting one or more aliases filters to only those. Tags like `phase:backend` allow additional grouping refinements.

**Logging:** Import logs at INFO level for start/finish with counts, DEBUG for per-task decisions, and ERROR for parse/validation failures. Check API logs during failures by filtering for the `roadmap-generation` component.

## Real-Time Updates

The API broadcasts events via WebSocket (`/ws` endpoint) on every state change:

| Event          | Trigger                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `task:created` | New task created                      |
| `task:updated` | Task fields updated                   |
| `task:moved`   | Task status changed via state machine |
| `task:deleted` | Task deleted                          |
| `agent:wake`   | Coordinator should check for work     |

The web UI connects via `useWebSocket` hook and invalidates React Query caches on incoming events. The agent coordinator also subscribes to this WebSocket to receive wake signals for immediate task processing (see Agent Pipeline above).

### Activity Logging

Agent tool events are tracked in each task's `agentActivityLog` field. Two modes are supported (configured via `ACTIVITY_LOG_MODE`):

- **sync** (default): Each event writes immediately to the database.
- **batch**: Events are buffered in an in-memory queue per task and flushed when the batch size, max age timer, or stage boundary is reached. Shutdown handlers ensure buffered entries are persisted on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`.

## Database

SQLite via `better-sqlite3` with `drizzle-orm` for type-safe queries. Schema is defined in `packages/shared/src/schema.ts`, and all DB reads/writes are executed through `packages/data/src/index.ts`.

Key tables:

- **tasks** — task data, status, plan/logs, heartbeat metadata, runtime override fields (`runtime_profile_id`, `model_override`, `runtime_options_json`), runtime session id (`session_id`)
- **runtime_profiles** — project-scoped or global runtime/provider profiles with non-secret transport/model config
- **projects** — project metadata plus default runtime profile ids for tasks and chat
- **chat_sessions / chat_messages** — persisted chat state with runtime profile/session linkage
- **task_comments** — human/agent comments with optional attachments

### Indexes

Runtime index bootstrap creates the following indexes via `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` at startup:

- `idx_tasks_status` — coordinator stage filtering
- `idx_tasks_retry_after` — blocked-task retry scans
- `idx_tasks_project_id` — project-scoped task lists
- `idx_tasks_status_retry` — composite for coordinator retry queries
- `idx_tasks_project_status` — composite for ordered task-list queries
- `idx_task_comments_task_id` — comment lookups by task
- `idx_tasks_locked` — parallel execution: find unlocked or stale-locked tasks
