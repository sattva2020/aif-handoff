 * Runtime-neutral builders for tool-related `RuntimeEvent`s.

 * helpers so consumers (chat UI, activity log, telemetry) see an identical
 * event shape regardless of which runtime produced them.
 *
 * Contract:
 * - A tool invocation always produces a `tool:use` event.
 * - If the tool is an interactive question (e.g. Claude's `AskUserQuestion`,
 *   Codex's future equivalent), the adapter parses its native input into a
 *   `RuntimeToolQuestionPayload` and passes it via `questionPayload` so a
 *   `tool:question` event is emitted alongside `tool:use`.
